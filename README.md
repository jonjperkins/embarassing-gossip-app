This project creates a site where users can post gossip. 
Anyone who visits the site can see the posts, but only logged-in users can 
see who authored the posts.

View the app on heroku at <a href="https://arcane-headland-38435.herokuapp.com/">Gossip App</a>

Use "foo@bar.com" (password: foobar) to demo the app.
